# CS2235-HW5
Using the SinglyLinkedList class from the lectures (the code will be posted to Moodle), modify your code from Homework 4 to use a singly linked 
list rather than the Scoreboard class for problems 1,2 and 3. 2. Create a DoublyLinkedList class using the SinglyLinkedList class as a reference. 
Note*Hint* Pages 136-137 from the book contain much of the code and you are welcome to reference them; just make sure you understand it (these slides will be
posted to Moodle for your reference). 3. Finally, modify your code from Homework 4 once again, this time using the DoublyLikedList. (Again, only parts 1-3)
